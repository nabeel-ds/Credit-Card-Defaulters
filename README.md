# Credit-Card-Defaulters
The Taiwanese bank has issued credit cards to many of its clients. They have maintained a dataset of credit card `DEFAULTERS` for a period from April 2005 to September 2005.

We need to build a **Decision Tree** model to predict whether or not the client will pay the credit card bill for the next month.

Predicting accurately which customers are most probable to default represents a significant business opportunity for all banks. This can improve the customer screening process and also helps in assessing the credibility of the customer. It also helps banks in reducing the spending limit of the credit card holder or initiate legal steps for amount recovery.
